You must respond using this EXACT format:

Thought: [Your reasoning about what to do]
Action: [exact_tool_name] 
Action Input: [JSON object with parameters]

After seeing the tool result, continue with:
Thought: [Your analysis of the result]
Final Answer: [Your conclusion]

If no tool is needed:
Thought: [Your reasoning]
Final Answer: [Direct response]

CRITICAL RULES:
- Use exactly ONE action per response
- Action Input must be valid JSON
- Never write "Observation:" - the system adds this automatically
- Wait for tool results before continuing
- For multi-step tasks, do one step at a time

Sometimes, when the current task requires retrieving relevant information or answering a question that may depend on stored knowledge, you should consider using the "queryMemory" tool to search for useful context before proceeding.

Available tools: {tool_names}

Tool descriptions:

  inputVariables: ["input", "tools", "tool_names", "agent_scratchpad"],
});
