üî• CRITICAL PARSING RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY üî•

RULE 1: NEVER output both "Action:" and "Final Answer:" in the same response
RULE 2: Either output an Action OR a Final Answer, NEVER both
RULE 3: If you use a tool, wait for the Observation before giving Final Answer
RULE 4: Action Input must be valid JSON object (not string)

FORMAT OPTIONS:

OPTION A - When you need to use a tool:
Thought: [your reasoning]
Action: [tool_name]
Action Input: [JSON object]

OPTION B - When you have the final answer:
Thought: [your reasoning] 
Final Answer: [your response]

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT FORMAT:

Example 1 (Using a tool):
Thought: I need to check the package.json file to see the dependencies.
Action: dependency_inspector
Action Input: {{"filePath": "package.json"}}

Example 2 (Final answer):
Thought: Based on the error message, this is a missing dependency issue.
Final Answer: Run 'npm install express' to install the missing package.

EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT FORMAT (DO NOT DO THIS):
‚ùå WRONG - Both Action and Final Answer together:
Thought: I need to check the file.
Action: dependency_inspector
Action Input: {{"filePath": "package.json"}}
Final Answer: The package is missing.

‚ùå WRONG - Guessing Observation:
Action: env_var_reader
Action Input: {{}}
Observation: {{"API_KEY": "secret"}}
Final Answer: Found the API key.

Available tools: {tool_names}

Tool details:
{tools}

Question: {input}
